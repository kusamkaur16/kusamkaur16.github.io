              <p>If you thought coming up with a trendy wedding hashtag, using only e-vites, and having charging booths at your wedding meant you were having tech-filled nuptials, you've just nicked the tip of the iceberg. Heck, a couple just got married
                in virtual reality this summer! Tech can be infused into every part of the wedding, including the planning, all the events surrounding the big day, the attire, the actual wedding, and, of course, documentation. Plus, your guests can totally
                benefit from some of these new platforms as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether you're just starting your wedding-planning adventure or checking off the very last things on your wedding checklist, here are our favorite digital tools (besides Brides.com, obvs) for planning the wedding you want while still having a life.</p>

                    <p>The very first step is to establish a tangible goal and objectives. (e.g., why are you organizing this event and what do you hope to achieve?) Any event takes a concerted team effort to handle all of the details. Consider identifying
                      one key Event Manager or Event Chair as well as individual Chairpersons for subcommittees.

                    <p>Out of all stages of event planning, this one is, obviously, super important for your client. To enable high brand recognition, you have to make it stand out. Start from brainstorming your crazy ideas. Capture them in all flavors and
                      colors and then think what will match the theme of your event in the best way. NB: The most memorable aspects of your show should be a tagline and logo. That’s what really counts. That’s what you have to do perfectly.</p>

                  <li><span>3</span>
                    <p>One of the most hard-to-ignore stages of planning an event is aligning your needs with the real budget you have. To handle it wisely, think of any sources of external funding from sponsorships first and then assign the realistic cost
                      to the rest of the items.</p>
